# RHOCP has two groups and bindings
# cluster-role 	- cluster level
# local-role 	- only project level

# use the add-cluster-role-to-user to give cluster level permissions
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-role username

# eg give cluster admin to user
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin username

# to remove 
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user cluster-role username

# use who-can to view current permissions
oc adm policy who-can delete user

# here is a list of default roles
#	admin 		- manage all project resources, including granting access to other users
#	basic-user	- read access to project
#	cluster-admin	- superuser access (full control)
# 	cluster-status	- can get cluster status info
# 	edit		- create/change/delete common app resources from a project
#			  cannot act on mgmt resources like limits/quotas/or manage permissions
#	self-provisioner- can create new project (cluster role NOT project role)
#	view		- view project resources but cannot modify

# admin role gives user access to project resources such as quotas/limit ranges/create new apps
# edit role gives user access to act as a developer inside a project

# add a role to a user using add-role-to-user
oc adm policy add-role-to-user role-name username -n project
oc adm policy add-role-to-user basic-user dev -n wordpress

# there are diff types of users
# 	regular users	- allowed access to platform
#	system users	- created automatically when the infrastructure is defined
#			  system:admin, system:openshift-registry, system:node:node1.example.com
#	service accounts- system users associated with projectso
#			  system:serviceaccount:default:deployer, system:serviceaccount:foo:builder
